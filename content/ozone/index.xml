      <description>To verify Hadoop Ozone releases using GPG:  Download the release hadoop-ozone-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz from a mirror site. Download the signature file hadoop-ozone-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz.asc from Apache. Download the Hadoop KEYS file. gpg &amp;ndash;import KEYS gpg &amp;ndash;verify hadoop-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz.asc  To perform a quick check using SHA-256:  Download the release hadoop-ozone-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz from a mirror site. Download the checksum hadoop-ozone-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz.mds from Apache. shasum -a 256 hadoop-ozone-X.Y.Z-src.tar.gz  All previous releases of Hadoop Ozone are available from the Apache release archive site.</description>

      <description>What is Ozone? Ozone is an object store designed for big data applications. Big data workloads tend to be very different from standard workloads and Ozone is born out of lessons learned from running Hadoop in thousands of clusters.
Why an Object Store? Object stores are more straightforward to build and use than standard file systems. It is also easier to scale an object store. The fact that most big data applications and frameworks like Apache Spark, YARN and Hive can run both on cloud and on-prem, makes having an object store on-prem very attractive.</description>
